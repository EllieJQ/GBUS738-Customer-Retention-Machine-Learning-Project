# GBUS738-Customer-Retention-Machine-Learning-Project
The telecom_df data frame contains information on the customers of a large U.S. telecommunications company which provides Internet and cellular service.  The company is looking to see if it can determine the factors that lead to customers canceling their service and whether it can predict if a customer will cancel their service in the future.  The company has experienced record levels of customers leaving their service in the past couple of years and this is leading to large financial losses.  The goal is to become better at identifying customers at risk of canceling their service to minimize financial losses.
